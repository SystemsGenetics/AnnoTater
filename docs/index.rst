Welcome to EnTAP for Nextflow (EnTAPnf) documentation!
======================================================

EnTAPnf is a `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/>`_ workflow that executes the Eukaryotic Non-Model Transcriptome Annotation Pipeline (EnTAP). EnTAP is designed to improve the accuracy, speed, and flexibility of functional gene annotation for both genomes and de novo assembled transcriptomes in non-model eukaryotes.

nf-core Compatibility
---------------------
EnTAPnf is an `nf-core <https://nf-co.re/>`_ compatible workflow.

Acknowledgments
---------------
EnTAP-nf was originally named AnnoTater and was written by the `Ficklin Computational Biology Team <http://ficklinlab.cahnrs.wsu.edu/>`_ at `Washington State University <http://www.wsu.edu>`_. Originally it was anticipated that it would provide very similar functionality as EnTAP, developed by the `Wegrzyn Plant Computational Genomics Lab <http://plantcompgenomics.com/>`_ at the `University of Connecticut <http://www.uconn.edu>`_. Rather than develop a competing workflow, AnnoTater was renamed to EnTAPnf and incorporates EnTAP to provide the high-quality in-silico annotations. EnTAPnf brings scalability to EnTAP.

Development of EnTAPnf was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Award `#1659300 <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1659300&HistoricalAwards=false>`_. It was funded separately from the EnTAP stand-alone tool. Please see the `EnTAP <https://entap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ documentation for its funding sources.
